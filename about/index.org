Since managing to move a picture of Mario from left to right on my Commando 64,
I have never lost the satisfaction of programming.

I moved to the UK and completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Durham
University, and have worked in the field ever since. Nowadays, although not
fully hands-on at work, I still find spare time to tinker with my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] setup
with a bit of lisp code. I use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] as the single souce of truth for
organising all my notes and agenda. You can say I live in Emacs & Org-mode.

** Work
   I work at one of the UK's largest media companies. I am the Head of
   Engineering in a team called Product Platforms. I love both technologies and
   people development. I used to give software craftsmanship coaching sessions
   to my team members in my previous work.

   The opinions expressed on this website are solely my own and not necessarily
   those of my employer.

** Blog
   Over the years I have tried and failed to maintain a blog countless
   times. The idea of writing something useful for others was overwhelming. The
   only achievement I had was that I once made a popular WordPress theme (for
   WordPress v0.7), released it and chalked up a Google Page Rank of 5.

   Nowadays I find even [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] has too high a barrier for me to publish
   anything. Since I use org-mode for organising my notes already, I figured out
   that I can use org's built-in publishing system to share my random thoughts.

   Covid-19 lockdown helped me to sit down and put this site together.

** Talks
   To fulfil my goal to be a humble lifelong learner, I believe that learning &
   teaching are equally important. I intend to put more effort in participating
   in public speaking. Here is a talk I gave on Web Performance:

   starting point to build this website.
