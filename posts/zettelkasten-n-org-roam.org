** Why Taking Notes At All
   I started taking notes when I was in elementary school. I am absolutely
   convinced that it is a good habit in learning new subjects.
  
   The action of writing things down involves multiple senses working together
   to create stronger memory.
   
   Taking notes in your own words forces you to think deeply about the ideas
   beyond the passages. To truly understand an idea is not the same as to merely
   comprehend the written text itself. The 'translation' process is the essence
   of note-taking. It integrates the newly-learned idea with your existing
   knowledge network. The benefit of linking your knowledge is more like compound
   interests instead of linear addition. On the other hand, copying text word by
   word doesn't automatically make you understand the ideas.
   
   Taking notes in meetings and conversations help us concentrate and avoid
   daydreaming, this is particularly useful in the age of working remotely with
   back-to-back Zoom calls.
   
   Notes crystallise our thoughts in the precise moment when they emerge. Any
   form of coming-back-later is a waste of time. Repetition doesn't guarantee
   better understanding of the ideas because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#:~:text=Confirmation%20bias%20is%20the%20tendency,evidence%2Dbased%20decision%2Dmaking.][our memory is very selective]]. The
   action of highlighting-for-later is the same as putting things on your
   back-burner. It's better to deal with them now or discard them completely.
   Wasting mental energy to manage more back-burners is counterproductive. Our
   short-term memory and focus are all limited, overloading them will only cause
   us stress.
   
   Taking notes empties our short-term memory. This means we can use our main
   focus to think about the order, the relationship and the clarity between the
   ideas we are trying to make sense of. Writing down thoughts doesn't mean we
   are going to forget about what we have learned. The action of linking the
   ideas strengthens our understanding. The idea of freeing out short-term
   memory is also used in David Allen's book /Getting Things Done/.

   However, I always felt I am not taking notes the right way, or perhaps I just
   have really bad memroy. There are times I couldn't remember much about the
   books I've spent days reading about a couple of months ago. The volumes of
   notebooks on my bookshelf often felt foreign to me, as if they were from
   somebody else.

   It all changed when I learned about Zettlekasten.

** What is Zettelkasten
   Zettelkasten (German: "slip-box") is a note taking method for knowledge
   management and writing. It is what made Niklas Luhmann, a self-made public
   servant to sociologist professor who wrote 58 books and over 400 papers
   during his lifetime - with more published based on his manuscripts after his
   death, a prolific scholar. Zettelkasten seems to have gained popularity in
   the past few years, especially with the popular not-taking application [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam
   Research]].

   As a result of extensive work with this technique a kind of secondary memory
   will arise, an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate. It proves to
   be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly
   constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no
   linear structure like a book. Just because of this, it gets its own life,
   independent of its author.

   The idea of communicating with your second brain is very powerful. It's like
   you have a Google with all your own ideas and writings. I find it's
   particularly interesting as it resonates with my idea of 'searching over
   organising'. I believe we should be able to have dialogues with our brain and
   notebooks to ask questions.
   
   The method itself is very simple to practice. You use small index cards for
   note taking. Each card ("Zettel" in German) has an ID, a set of contexts
   (tags) and references to other cards. All the cards are stored in a
   slip-box. You then create indexes with key terms of important notes as entry
   points for querying your knowledge (the second brain). Luhman also has a
   slip-box dedicated for bibliography.

   The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Tst3-zcWI&ab_channel=Zettlr][Zettelkasten Manifesto]] explains the concept very well.

** Key Principles of Zettelkasten
   In order to truly realise the effectiveness of the Zettelkasten method, there
   are few key principles (or at least the ideas behind them) need to be
   followed religiously.

   + Each card holds a single idea - an *atomic concept* that can be understood
     by itself.  This makes each card useful in more than one context and it
     increases the surface area for enquiry.
    
   + Use specific and contextual tags, avoid categories. 'Finance' or 'Holiday'
     are not good tags in Zettelkasten. In what context would you want to find
     information about 'Finance'? It's too wide. A better version would be
     'Money Saving Tips' or 'Places I Want to Visit in Africa'. When you tag the
     notes, don't automatically link them to the most obvious and most commonly
     used tags. Think hard about in what contexts this note may be useful. This
     deliberate practice of linking is the essence of Zettelkasten. The existing
     keywords are warnings, they are not cues.
    
   + Build the links among cards through references. The practice of
     deliberately building links helps you connect ideas. Building links from
     bottom-up means you have to constantly update your links as you gain new
     knowledge and insights.
    
** How to Take Smart Notes
   Apart from reading articles from [[https://zettelkasten.de/][zettelkasten.de]], I've also read the book [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y][How
   to Take Smart Notes]] from SÃ¶nke Ahrens. There are plenty of resources on the
   Internet about Zettelkasten but none explains the idea as in depth as Ahrens'
   book.

   The core idea of the book is that there are two parts in note-taking. The
   first one is to write a summary of the main ideas in your own words. The
   second part is to create links between the new ideas and the existing
   concepts in your slip-box. They are equally important.

   If you want to give the book a try, I recommend at least try Zettelkasten at
   the same time while reading the book. I learnt about slip-boxes on the
   Internet, bought the book and started to use the Zettelkasten method to read
   this very book about Zettelkasten. I kept improving my Zettelkasten note
   taking techniques as I went through the book. There were many aha moments
   which I probably would not be able to get from reading the book for the first
   time if I didn't practice this technique at all.

   The book categorised notes into a few types. Below is my own interpretation
   of how Zettels should be organised.
   
** Five Types of Notes
   + Fleeting notes :: Your scrawls on serviettes, brown bags, or coffee shop
     receipts. They are random ideas you jolted down while you were reading,
     waiting in the queue or talking with a friend. Make sure you process them
     within a day or two while the memory is still fresh. You can bin these
     after you've turned them into permanent notes.
   
  + Permanent notes :: Notes that represent atomic ideas which can be understood
    in their own contexts. I occasionally create notes only to connect related
    ideas when they are too big to fit into one zettel. The title of the Zettel
    should be descriptive. The first sentence or paragraph should be the summary
    of the idea.
   
  + Literature notes :: Summarise the content of a book, publication or blog
    post and give the citation, in the format of "on page X of Y, it says Z"You
    can keep a separate bibliography slip-box with tools such as [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zetora]] or
    [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]].
   
  + Index notes :: Index notes are the entry points to the universe inside your
    slip-box. Each index should link as few notes as possible (Luhmann links
    maximum three). Index notes are not tables of contents which have links to
    everything in the slip-box. The key idea is to use the key links to discover
    more notes by traversing through the network.  If you use a digital
    Zettelkasten system this type of notes may not be necessary - back-links can
    be discovered by the software easily
   
  + Project notes :: Notes that serve as 'folders' for specific projects. You
    can archive them or bin them once the projects are done. You draw ideas
    from your permanent notes but you don't change them for the projects - keep
    the modifications for the project specific context inside the project
    notes.
    
** Org-Roam
   As a dedicated Emacser, the first thought in my mind was that I have to
   implement the idea with Emacs. Fortunately you have the wonderful
   [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org-Roam]]. It's straightforward to [[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/][get started]].


This article itself is a result of my Zettelkasten with Org-Roam. This wonderful
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWic15iXjk&ab_channel=NatEliason][video]] taught me how to outline an article with Zettels in 20 minutes.
